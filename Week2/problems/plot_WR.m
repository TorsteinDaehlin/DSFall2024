function plot_WR(x, y, c)

% TODO:
% - Plot the x and y data using the 'LineStyle' property to ensure that the
%   data is plotted as a continuous line and the 'Color' property to set the
%   colour to the value of c.

% TODO: 
% - Turn hold on (make sure to leave it on. We will turn it off in the main
%   script).

% TODO:
% - Use the 'yline' function to plot a black horizontal line representing 
% the ground at y = 0.

% Annotate the time series
% TODO:
% - Create a variable named 'idx' that stores the index of the half-way
%   point between javelin release and when it hits the ground. Remember that
%   the index must be an integer (i.e., have no decimals).
% - Create a string variable named 'dist' containing  the current 
%   throwing distance with its unit. 
% - Use the 'text' funciton to plot the text stored in the variable 'dist'
%   at the half-way point of the world record plot (consider why we 
%   created an index variable). Set the 'Color' property to c, the 
%   'BackgroundColor' property to 'w', and the 'HorizontalAlignment'
%   property to 'center'
